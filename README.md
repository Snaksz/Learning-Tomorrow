# Learning-Tomorrow
LearningTomorrow is a platform that allows teachers to create a digital course for their students.
LearningTomorrow upgrades the current learning experience for students using a combination of written
notes, videos, and assessments such as practice quizzes and tests. The platform aims to create a better and
more accessible learning experience for students, while letting them learn at their own pace.
LearningTomorrow will enhance and add to the current functionality of educational learning platforms by
firstly, adding in accessibility features that enable people of low vision and other people with disabilities
to access LearningTomorrowâ€™s content. The features include text to speech, zooming in and zooming out
of the content, turning on a colour filter for people with colorblindness, and increasing font size.
